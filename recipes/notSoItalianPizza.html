  <h2>Directions</h2>

  <h4>Step 1</h4>

  <h4>Step 3</h4>
  <p>
    Divide in half and form into two tight dough balls. Coat with olive oil and refrigerate in a sealed container for at
    <br>
    least 16 hours. Be sure to use a big enough container to allow dough to rise.

  <h4>Step 4</h4>
  <p>
    Make the pizzas: Remove dough from the refrigerator one hour prior to using.
  </p>

  <h4>Step 5</h4>
  <p>
    Preheat the oven, with a pizza stone on the lowest rack, to 550 degrees F (288 degrees C). <br>Lightly dust a pizza
    peel with flour.
  </p>

  <h4>Step 6</h4>
  <p>
    Prepare the first pizza: Lightly dust one dough ball with flour and stretch gradually until <br> about 14 inches in
    diameter, or about the size of the pizza stone. Place on the floured <br>peel.

  <h4>Step 7</h4>
  <p>
    Lay 1/2 of the mozzarella on the crust, then sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon oregano and 1/8 teaspoon <br>pepper over the top.
    Randomly arrange 1/4 cup crushed tomatoes over the pizza, leaving <br>some empty areas, then drizzle 1 tablespoon
    olive oil over top.

  <h4>Step 8</h4>
  <p>
    With a quick back and forth jerk, make sure dough will release from the peel easily. Place <br>the tip of the peel
    at the back of the preheated pizza stone, and remove the peel so <br>that the pizza is left on the stone.
  </p>

  <h4>Step 9</h4>
  <p>
    Bake in the preheated oven until the crust begins to brown, 4 to 6 minutes.
  </p>

  <h4>Step 10</h4>
  <p>
    Slide the pizza onto the peel and remove from the oven; then slide off the peel onto a work <br>surface. Sprinkle
    1/2 of the basil leaves randomly over the pizza. Cut into wedges and <br>serve.
